# AHS CLASS OF 2003 TIME MACHINE
## *Powered by Nostalgix*

### The Concept
This isn't just a class reunion website. It's a **time machine**.
When you log in, you step back to 2003. The sounds, the interface,
the vibes - everything transports you. Then you get to see where
everyone ended up 20+ years later.

**Tagline ideas:**
- "Step back. Reconnect. Remember."
- "The year is 2003. Welcome back."
- "Your dial-up connection to the past."

### Sounds (CRITICAL)
